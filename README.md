# Lucky Spin project

This application is intended to showcase my knowledge of frontend web technologies such as HTML, CSS(SASS), JAVASCRIPT and for fun and to try your luck, this implies that you cannot deposit money and win any of the prizes. If you like my work or if you see an bug in the application that I missed, I would be grateful if you could point it out to me. Feel free to contact me at lazarpanoviÄ‡@yahoo.com .Good day, thank you again for using my application.

You can try app at https://laki-unbox.netlify.app/

For now, app doesn't work and looks great on some iOS mobile phones, and becouse of that all iOS users can't use and test app, sorry for that.
